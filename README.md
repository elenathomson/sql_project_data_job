# Data Jobs in the UK â€“ Final Project for SQL for Data Analytics Course

This is the README file to give you an overview of the project.
## Introduction
Do you want to know more about the job market for data professionals globally and in the UK in 2023? This project explores ðŸ“Š the most frequently posted jobs and ðŸ’° associated salaries for data professionals, as well as delving into the details of the ðŸ“ˆ Data Scientist role and ðŸ”¥ in-demand skills needed to succeed in the market. At the same time, this project showcases ðŸ’» my SQL coding skills and ðŸ“¢ my ability to clearly communicate the findings. 

SQL queries are available in the projectâ€™s [sql_queries](/sql_queries/) folder, and the R script to visualise key findings is in the [r_code](/r_code/) folder.

# Background
The motivation behind this project comes from my desire to better understand market trends for the Data Scientist role in the UK. I aimed to discover which skills are the most in demand and to identify patterns in the data job market, making potential job searches more targeted and effective. The data for this analysis came from **Luke Barousseâ€™s** [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. Data was collected in 2023 and is available to explore via the [Data.Nerd App](https://datanerd.tech).

The questions I aimed to answer through my SQL queries were:

[1. The most in demand roles in the UK market.](#1-the-most-in-demand-roles-in-the-uk-market)

[2. The top-paying roles based on average yearly salary in the UK.](#2-the-top-paying-roles-based-on-average-yearly-salary-in-the-uk)

[6b. Part-time offerings by company](#6b-which-companies-are-offering-part-time-options)

# Tools I used

In this project, I used a variety of tools to do my analysis such as:

**SQL (Structured Query Language):**  
The main tool and query language used to interact with the database. It allowed me to extract insights and answer key research questions.

**PostgreSQL:**  
A database management system that enabled me to store, query, and manipulate job posting data effectively.

**Visual Studio Code:**  
An open-source development and administration platform. It helped me manage the database, execute SQL queries, organise the project, and communicate results.

**R:**  
A programming language for statistical analysis, which I used to create insightful data visualisations based on the queried data.

**RStudio:**  
An integrated development environment (IDE) used for writing and executing R scripts, supporting efficient data visualisation.

**Git and GitHub:**  
A version control system and a cloud-based platform, respectively. These were used to track changes, store and manage the project, and share all SQL and R scripts. They also facilitated collaboration and communication of the analysis with others.


# The Analysis

### 1. The most in demand roles in the UK market

The first question was to understand the most in demand job roles in the UK market.

```sql
---Count the most common job titles in the database in the UK

SELECT     job_title_short, count(job_id) AS job_count
FROM       job_postings_fact
WHERE      job_location LIKE '%UK%' 
        OR job_location LIKE  '%United Kingdom%'
GROUP BY   job_title_short
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

*Table 1. Top 10 in demand jobs in the UK:*

| Job title                 | Demand count  |
|---------------------------|---------------|
| Data Engineer             | 10751         |
| Data Analyst              | 9555          |
| Data Scientist            | 8350          |
| Senior Data Engineer      | 2994          |
| Senior Data Scientist     | 2168          |
| Senior Data Analyst       | 1217          |
| Business Analyst          | 709           |
| Software Engineer         | 472           |
| Machine Learning Engineer | 260           |
| Cloud Engineer            | 169           |

**Key insights:**

**Data Engineer**, **Data Analyst** and **Data Scientist** are the top 3 job roles in the UK market.

**Data engineers** are leading the market  with over **10,000 roles**. In general engineers dominate the top data jobs. **Data Analysts** with more than **9,500** job roles are in high demand. **Data Scientists** with **8,350 roles** still make it a top-tier title, but not as fast-growing as engineering. Companies are scaling up and put into production their offering it is why the growing demand for engineers.
**Senior** job offers count around 22% of their junior counterparts which suggests a **maturing data workforce**, where companies now want **leaders** to scale and mentor teams. Particularly strong for **Senior Data Engineers** with **2,994** roles. There is also place for niche or specialised roles such as **Software Engineer**, **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Cloud Engineer**.



### 2. The top-paying roles based on average yearly salary in the UK.

I would like to understand what are the salary offers in the UK market.

``` sql
---Include the salary range
---Order by salary
---In the UK

SELECT job_title_short, 
    count(job_id) AS job_count, 
    MIN(salary_year_avg) AS min_yearly_salary, 
    MAX(salary_year_avg) AS max_yearly_salary,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 1) AS average_yearly_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
WHERE salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND (job_location LIKE '%UK%' 
        OR job_location LIKE  '%United Kingdom%')
GROUP BY job_title_short
ORDER BY average_yearly_salary DESC;
```

*Table 2. Top paying jobs in the UK:*

| Job title                | Demand count | Min yearly salary | Max yearly salary | Average yearly salary |
|---------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Machine Learning Engineer | 7         | 85205             | 200000            | 139564.4              |
| Senior Data Engineer      | 24        | 45000             | 171620            | 137550                |
| Senior Data Scientist     | 32        | 72500             | 170575            | 130277.4              |
| Data Engineer             | 53        | 45000             | 249000            | 121978                |
| Data Scientist            | 74        | 31500             | 205000            | 109193.5              |
| Senior Data Analyst       | 8         | 79200             | 118140            | 107314.4              |
| Software Engineer         | 5         | 89100             | 160000            | 103280                |
| Data Analyst              | 70        | 30000             | 180000            | 88536.9               |
| Business Analyst          | 5         | 30000             | 73500             | 49560                 |


**Key insights:**

It is important to mention that **number of job posting with salary** is not significant and represent only **0.8%** (`278/36645`).

There is a big **salary range** between starting junior position and senior roles especially for **Data Analyst** and **Data Scientist** roles. Junior roles can get as low as $30K/y 

It is worth mentioning the significant **title variety:** from Engineers to Analysts and many Senior roles.

The average yearly salary for different job titles is shown on the next figure. 



*Figure 1. Bar chart illustrating the top-paying roles in the UK in 2023:*

![Top Paying Roles ](r_plots/Top_paying_data_role.png)


**Machine Learning Engineers** earn the most with an average of **$139.5K**, they top the table. This could indicate a **highly specialised role** with **few qualified candidates**.
Both **Senior Data Engineers (Â£137.6K)** and **Senior Data Scientists (Â£130.3K)** get high salaries. **Data Engineers** earn slightly more **~$122K** on average compared to **Data Scientists** at **$109K**. **Senior Data Analysts ($107K)** do earn well, but still below senior engineering/science roles. **Data Analysts ($88.5K)** and **Business Analysts ($49.6K)** are significantly behind. Unfortunately, less technical complexity is equal to lower salaries as a bigger part of analyst role is focusing on reporting, insight, and stakeholder communication that is not as well paid as niche technical skills.




 *Table 3. Salary trends by role type:*

| **Role Type**            | **Salary Range ($)** | **Trend** |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Machine Learning Roles** | ~85K â€“ 200K           | Highest pay; niche, deep expertise |
| **Data Engineering**     | 45K â€“ 249K            | Surging demand and pay; core to data platforms |
| **Data Science**         | 31K â€“ 205K            | Broadly in demand, slightly lower average |
| **Analysis & Insight**   | 30K â€“ 180K            | More common, but lower salary bands |


---


If you're aiming for high earnings in the UK data space then **Machine Learning Engineering** is the role to go, but it requires deep technical investment. **Data Engineering** is the most **scalable opportunity**, offering high pay and wide demand. **Data Scientist role** remains the most in demand and well paid role. Analysts are **great for entry and mid-career**, but may have salary ceilings without transitioning into more technical or strategic roles.

**Key insights:**

The results are consistent with the previous question. Indicating that sql database, programming languages and cloud tech are in demand and well paid. 

High salaries often linked to niche technologies such as **Oracle**, **NoSQL** and **BigQuery** hinting at a premium for specialised expertise in big data infrastructure. Cloud platforms are a major salary driver: **GCP ($108,249)** and **AWS ($103,561)** as well as **Azure (Â£103,430)** are well-paid. While not topping the salary list, **Python ($106,973)** and **SQL ($105,690)** are by far the most requested skills. Tools for Analytics and Visualisation are also well-rewarded. **Tableau ($108,154.50)** and **Looker ($97,833.50)** both appear with relatively high salaries reflecting the importance of business-facing insights. Interestingly, **Excel** still holds its own, earning **$97,232**, showing it remains a backbone skill in many organisations.

**Strategic Takeaway**

For UK-based data scientists looking to **maximise earning potential**, the combination of **cloud expertise**, **niche toolsets**, and **strong foundational programming (Python/SQL)** offers the most leverage. While high-paying roles may be fewer in number, they **reward depth in specialised tools** over breadth alone.

### What I learned
This project helped me to enhance my SQL and analytical skills, as well as my ability to clearly communicate the findings. Using PostgreSQL I built a new database from scratch and performed complex queries using JOIN and WITH clauses for the Common Table Expressions (CTEs). I gained a deeper understanding of market trends for Data Scientist roles in the UK and identified the most in-demand skills in the data job market. The insights obtained from this project have the potential to inform and improve job search strategies.
